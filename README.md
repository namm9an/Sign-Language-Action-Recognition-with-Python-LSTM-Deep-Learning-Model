# Sign Language using Action Recognition with Python

This project aims to detect and recognize sign language gestures using action recognition techniques implemented with Python and LSTM deep learning models.

## Overview

Sign language recognition is crucial for improving communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to recognize and classify sign language gestures from video sequences.

## Features

- Implementation of LSTM deep learning model for action recognition.
- Python-based framework for processing sign language gestures.
- Training pipeline for fine-tuning and optimizing model accuracy.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the LSTM model.
- Visualization tools for understanding model predictions and classification results.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
